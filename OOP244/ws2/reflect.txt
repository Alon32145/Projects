1)
cout.
During the lab in both part 1 and part 2 cout is used to display data (like printf).
cout works by copying data from system memory into an output stream, in the copying process cout copies system memory into a sequence of characters.

Another thing that was used in the lab is function overloading.
In CPP you can have a function that has multiple meaning. The way that the compiler can distinguish each function meaning it needs to use by the different parameters each function has.



2)
An out parameter represents information which is passed from the function back to its caller.  
An in parameter represents information which is being passed from the caller to the function. Input parameters are usually values or const references.

An example of in parameter can be found in the last part of DIY when the population of Canada is calculated.
In this case information from the struct  pointer is being passed into a function display and is being stored in totalPop.
