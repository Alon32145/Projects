// I have done all the coding by myself and only copied the code that my professor provided to complete my workshops and assignments.

During this lab we had covered derived classes and functions.

During the lab we had created a friend class called TextFile.


A derived class is a class that is created from an existing class.
A derived class inherits all of members and member function from base class.

In order to define a derived class you need to name the derived class : followed by a base class name.

Also the derived class had to be fully private due to the task of class line which is to encapsulate a single line of text. In order to achieve it we had to make class Text File fully private so Line could not access it.

Other then that the lab went smoothly I did encounter a few problem memory problems with Line::operator but it was due to improperly loading the save As derived class function member.
Other then that the lab went smoothly the error was quite simple to debug and I did not experience and other problems with the code.
