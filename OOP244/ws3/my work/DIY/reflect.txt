In this workshop I was introduced to classes for the first time. For some reason I overcomplicated things for my self with understanding how methods work.
I probably struggled the most with editing the lines to print purely because of syntax.
Otherwise the lab went quite smoothly I used the code from the lab we had in class few days prior.
The most significant modifications I made to the code were converting the public methods double price and tax to match the new variables required for this lab.
Other than that I switched the type of and name of few more variables in food.h and CalorieList.h to suit the DIY.
In conclusion the lab was not complicated but it was a bit challenging as it tested my skills on a new subject that I was not familiar with before.
