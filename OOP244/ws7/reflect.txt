// I have done all the coding by myself and only copied the code that my professor provided to complete my workshops and assignments.

During this lab I learned what is a derived class and how it operates.
In this lab we have 2 classes the main one being MotorVehicle and the derived one being
Truck.

In addition to using derived classes in this workshop I am also using them in the milestones.

What is a derived class? A derived class is a class is class which is created from an existing class.
The derived class inherits all members and member functions of the original class (base class).
The derived class can have more functionality with respect to the original class and can easily access the original class.


In addition to derived classes we had also used custom I/O operators.
We had modified those operators by slightly changing the data that they return.

One thing we also did is using the derived class we overloaded a few functions from the original class such as the read and write functions .
