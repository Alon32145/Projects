In this lab we had worked with virtual functions.

A virtual function in C++ is a member function of a base class that you override in a derived class. It is declared with the virtual keyword. It is used to tell the compiler to perform dynamic binding or late function binding.

Proper use of virtual functions allowes polymorphism. What is polymorphism?

polymorphism is an attribute that allows the same interface to be used when implementing a whole class of different actions. The choice of which action to take is determined by the specific situation.

polymorphism is important for object-oriented programming because it allows functions of a base class to be overridden in descendant classes in order to have their version applied to that particular class. Thus, a base class defines a common interface that all derived classes have, and at the same time, polymorphism allows derived classes to have their own method implementations.
